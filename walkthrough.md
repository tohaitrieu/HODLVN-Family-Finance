# Walkthrough - Fix Data Validation Error

The error "The data you entered in cell D11 violates the data validation rules" occurs because the validation rules on your **Expense (CHI)** sheet are outdated and do not include new categories like "Cho vay".

## How to Fix

You do **NOT** need to delete your data. You just need to refresh the sheet's settings.

1.  **Open the Spreadsheet**.
2.  Go to the Menu: **"HODLVN Family Finance"** > **"⚙️ Khởi tạo Sheet"**.
3.  Select: **"📤 Khởi tạo Sheet CHI"**.
4.  Click **"Yes"** when asked for confirmation.
    *   *Note: This will re-apply the correct formatting and validation rules without deleting your existing rows.*
5.  **Verify**:
    *   Try entering "Cho vay" in the "Danh mục" column of the "CHI" sheet. It should now be accepted.
    *   Retry your Crypto transaction or whatever action caused the error.
